# Lec 2: Additional Topics

Author: Jeremy Gu

!!! note

    In each lecture, we will have a section called "Additional Topics" covering concepts that, due to our fast-paced curriculum, we may not have time to cover in class. However, I believe understanding these is important for fully mastering data streaming. I may also include recommended readings and coding exercises to reinforce your learning. Note that additional topics will not be on the midterm exam. In your future work, I encourage revisiting these to strengthen your data streaming knowledge. 

## Asynchronous Producer and Synchronous Producer

Below is a table that summarizes the use of `flush()`, `poll()`, and other methods for both asynchronous and synchronous Kafka producers:


| **Method/Action** | **Asynchronous Producer** | **Synchronous Producer** |
|--------------------|---------------------------|--------------------------|
| **flush()**       | **Used (After all messages)** - Called once after the loop has produced all messages to ensure that all of them have been delivered. It waits up to the given timeout for the delivery report callbacks to be triggered. | **Used (After each message)** - Called within the loop, after each `produce()`, to ensure that the current message is delivered and acknowledged before sending the next one. |
| **poll()**        | **Used** - Can be used within the loop or after it, primarily to trigger the delivery report callback and get feedback about the delivery status of messages. If used after the loop (as in the provided example), it will process delivery reports for all previously sent messages. | **Used (Typically within the loop)** - Triggered within the loop to get immediate feedback about the delivery status of each message. While `flush()` does a similar job, `poll()` allows more granular control and immediate feedback on delivery status. |
| **callback**      | **Used** - Callback functions (like `delivery_report`) are used to handle delivery reports asynchronously. They provide feedback about the delivery status of each message. | *Optional* - While callbacks can be used in synchronous producers, they're not as essential since you're relying on `flush()` to wait for acknowledgment. However, callbacks can provide more detailed information about the delivery. |

| **flush()**       | **Used (After all messages)** - Called once after the loop has produced all messages to ensure that all of them have been delivered. It waits up to the given timeout for the delivery report callbacks to be triggered. | **Used (After each message)** - Called within the loop, after each `produce()`, to ensure that the current message is delivered and acknowledged before sending the next one. |
| **poll()**        | **Used** - Can be used within the loop or after it, primarily to trigger the delivery report callback and get feedback about the delivery status of messages. If used after the loop (as in the provided example), it will process delivery reports for all previously sent messages.| *Optional* - Not typically required in a purely synchronous producer since `flush()` waits for message acknowledgment. However, if you wanted feedback about delivery status after each message, you could use it. |
| **callback**      | **Used** - Callback functions (like `delivery_report`) are used to handle delivery reports asynchronously. They provide feedback about the delivery status of each message. | *Optional* - While callbacks can be used in synchronous producers, they're not as essential since you're relying on `flush()` to wait for acknowledgment. However, callbacks can provide more detailed information about the delivery. |

Remember that in real-world scenarios, you might find hybrid approaches based on the exact requirements of your application. The above distinctions are generalized to help you understand the conceptual differences between the two types of producers.

## Terminology Review

| Term | Definition | Example |
|-|-|-|
| Synchronous | Operations prevent subsequent operations from starting until they are completed. | When on a phone call, you can't start a second call. |
| Sequential | Operations occur in a specific order, one after the other. | For breakfast, first brew the coffee, then fry the eggs. |
| Parallel | Multiple operations or tasks execute independently at the exact same time. | A multi-core CPU can execute multiple tasks simultaneously. |
| Concurrent | Multiple operations or tasks start within the same timeframe, but might not start at the exact same moment; they may interleave or execute simultaneously. | While cooking, you can concurrently do laundry. |
| Asynchronous | Once an operation starts, there's no need to wait for its completion; you can continue other operations. Upon completion of the original operation, a notification is typically given, often through mechanisms like callbacks. | Email is sent in the background; you're notified once it's sent. |


## Fire and Forget

"Fire and Forget" is a term commonly used in distributed systems and messaging architectures to describe a pattern where the producer sends a message and doesn't wait or care about the acknowledgment of its receipt or its processing status. In the context of Kafka, this would mean sending a message to the broker without waiting for any acknowledgment of its delivery.

In the Kafka producer scenarios we discussed:

1. **Asynchronous Producer:** This can be considered a form of "Fire and Forget" if you remove the callbacks and the `flush()` method. You just "fire" messages to the broker in a loop and don't bother checking if they were received or if there were any errors.

2. **Synchronous Producer:** This is the opposite of "Fire and Forget." Every message is sent, and the producer waits for its acknowledgment before proceeding.

For a true "Fire and Forget" scenario with a Kafka producer in Python, the code might look something like:

```python
from confluent_kafka import Producer

config = {
    # ... your Kafka configuration ...
}

producer = Producer(config)

def produce_messages_fire_and_forget(producer, topic_name, num_messages=10):
    """Fire and forget message production."""
    for _ in range(num_messages):
        message_value = "Some message value"
        producer.produce(topic_name, value=message_value)
        
# Use the function
produce_messages_fire_and_forget(producer, "your_topic_name")
```

In the above, messages are sent without any checks or waits for acknowledgment. This method can achieve **higher throughput** because it doesn't involve the overhead of checking message delivery status. However, it comes at the **potential cost of not knowing** about failed deliveries, so it's best used in scenarios where occasional message loss is acceptable.
