        <p>Encouraging effective group discussions and collaborations.</p>
        <p>Write your own code and homework independently. Do not copy & paste code from your classmates.</p>
        <p>Using ChatGPT or other LLM models is <strong>acceptable</strong>. But you need to write your own words and own code. If so, please tell the instructor which line(s) of code or which pieces of the homework are from those LLM AI models. Most of the time, it's easier to write your own code than debug what ChatGPT gives to you.</p>
        <p>Zero tolerance in <strong>CHEATING</strong> and <strong>PLAGIARISM</strong>.</p>
