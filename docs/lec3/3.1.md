## How Kafka tracks of Consumer offsets?

Kafka keeps track of Consumer Offsets by storing them in a special topic named `__consumer_offsets`.

Here's a concise example:

When a consumer reads a message from a topic's partition and wants to save its progress, it commits the offset of that message to the `__consumer_offsets` topic.

ASCII Diagram:
```
+-------------------------+
|    Topic: user_logs     |
+-------------------------+
| Offset 3: Log Entry C   |
|-------------------------|      +-------------------------------+
| Offset 4: Log Entry D   |----->| __consumer_offsets Topic      |
|-------------------------|      | Consumer: A, Topic: user_logs |
| Offset 5: Log Entry E   |      | Partition: 0, Offset: 4       |
+-------------------------+      +-------------------------------+
```

In the diagram, the consumer has last read "Log Entry D" from the `user_logs` topic's partition 0 at offset 4. This progress is saved in the `__consumer_offsets` topic, which means if the consumer restarts, it knows to resume from offset 5 of `user_logs`. Some key points:

- `__consumer_offsets` is a special Kafka topic
- Consumers write their latest offset to this topic
- This allows Kafka to track consumer position
- If a consumer dies, it can resume from the committed offset
